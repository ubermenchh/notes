An agreed-upon formalism designed to manipulate a memory using a processor and a set of registers.

### Memory
- collection of hardware devices
- store data and instructions
- continuous sequence of cells -> *locations* or *memory registers*, each having a unique *address*.
- a memory register is accessed by providing its address
### Processor
- device capable of performing fixed set of primitive operations.
- arithmetic and logical operations
- memory access operations
- control (branching) operations
- consists of an ALU, a set of registers and gate logic that enables it to parse and execute binary instructions.
### Registers
